A react typescript based Musicplay web app for pcs.

It allows user to search the music and add those musics in favourite list and user can also have the playlist of music based on different genres,

# The keycloak code part is taken from https://github1s.com/ChristianHuff-DEV/react-keycloak-authentication/tree/main

my webapp is only made for pcs ,so i didnt apply media queries in it hence its not responsive myweb app has authentication from keycloak using docker,

# keycloak credentials
the password ,username,realm all i kept as "vikash"

after the validation only home screen comes.
